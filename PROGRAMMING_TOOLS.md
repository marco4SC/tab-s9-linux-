# Programming Tools Setup for Tab S9 FE

This document provides detailed setup instructions for essential programming languages and tools required for computer engineering studies on the Tab S9 FE.

## Python Setup
1. **Install Python**: Download the installer from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Follow the installation guide to complete the setup.
2. **Install pip**: Make sure pip is included during the installation. Verify by running `pip --version` in the terminal.
3. **Install Virtualenv** (optional): Use `pip install virtualenv` to create isolated Python environments.
4. **Install key libraries**: Use `pip install numpy pandas matplotlib` to install essential libraries for scientific computing and data visualization.

## C++ Setup
1. **Install a C++ Compiler**: For Linux-based systems, you can install `g++` using your package manager, e.g. `sudo apt install g++` for Ubuntu.
2. **Install an IDE/Text Editor**: Options include VS Code, Code::Blocks, or CLion. Choose based on preference and install accordingly.
3. **Test Installation**: Write a simple "Hello, World!" program to verify everything is working correctly.
